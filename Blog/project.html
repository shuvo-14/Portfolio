              <h3>Desert Rally</h3>
              <p>
                Desert Rally is using Visual Programming to create kind of
                Endless Game. I use Scratch for my first time learning
                programming because it helps me to improve my logical thinking
                of how to sequencing the codes and make it work with just the
                codes provided. We can add Sprites as much as needed,
                background, backsound, even we can draw it ourselves. Scratch
                also provides additional extensions like translate or pen, even
                Cloud Variables if you want to make multiplayer game.

              <p>
                Memory Game helps you to improve your ability to memorize
                something with a fun way. This game created on Visual Studio
                Code with Javascript game framework, called Phaser. It becomes
                easier to create a game if you use framework because the code is
                more readable, easy to use, and they provide many object and
                clasess that ready to use. This Memory Game i have made has a
                player to control with key arrows. The player have to check
                every box to match it with others. It also has timer so you have
                to match all the items inside the box before the time is over.
